<!--Harris-Benedict Equation Based Formula

 For Men: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) - (5.677 x age in years).
 For Women: BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 x weight in kg) + (3.098 x height in cm) - (4.330 x age in years).

Mifflin St Jeor Equation Based Formula(I am using this formula as this is more accurate)

The Mifflin St Jeor equation based formula is considered more accurate than Harris-Benedict, especially for lean individuals.

 For Men: BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) + 5.
 For Women:BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) - 161.

        <p> <h2>WHAT IS BASAL METABOLIC RATE?</h2> 
            Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is primarily the amount of energy (in calories) that your body requires to 
            ensure that the basic or primary functions of the body are maintained while you are in a state of rest. 
            These basic or primary functions include:
            <ul>
                <li>Breathing</li>
                <li>Circulation of blood</li>
                <li>Regulation of body temperature</li> 
                <li>Digestion</li>
                <li>Cellular repair and Growth</li>
                <li>Other bodily functions</li>
            </ul>
            Basal Metabolic Rate is therefore the basic minimum amount of calories required to ensure that the above 
            life-sustaining functions are carried out while our bodies are at rest, i.e., no additional activity is being carried out by the body. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate">Click for More...</a>
